zsh-syntax-highlighting-filetypes
=================================

![image](/extra/zsh-syntax-hl-ft.png)

LS\_COLORS on your commandline in realtime as you type.

This is based on nicoulaj's [zsh-syntax-highlighting][0] project. I've taken the
initial version of his script and added highlighting for filetypes and a few
other things. The filetype highlighting rules are taken from my [LS_COLORS][1] project.

This will only work in terminals capable of displaying 256 colors.
